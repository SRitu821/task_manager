# Task Manager Application

This is a simple Task Manager app that allows users to add, update, delete, search, sort, set priority, and persist tasks in the browser's local storage. 

Features include:
- Add new tasks with a title and description.
- Mark tasks as complete and delete tasks.
- Search tasks by name.
- Sort tasks based on priority or creation date.
- Set task priorities (Low, Medium, High).
- Persist tasks in local storage, so tasks remain even after refreshing the page.

Technologies used:
- React.js
- CSS for styling
- Local Storage for task persistence

## Setup and Launch

## Assumptions

- The task ID is generated based on the current number of tasks.
